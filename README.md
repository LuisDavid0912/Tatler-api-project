<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the Project Description</strong></summary>

## 1. Project Description

This project is for the "Non-Relational Databases for Storing JSON Data" pathway. The goal is to transform Tatler, a traditional restaurant directory, into a modern, dynamic, and personalized application.

This repository contains the backend solution, which includes:
- A NoSQL database built with **MongoDB** to store and manage restaurant, review, and user data flexibly.
- A RESTful API developed with **Express.js** to interact with the database, allowing for functionalities like adding reviews, filtering restaurants, and searching by proximity.

**Version: 1.1.0**

## 3. Installation and Usage

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- MongoDB Community Server installed and running locally.

### Setup and Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:LuisDavid0912/Tatler-api-project.git
    cd Tatler-api-project
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs Express, MongoDB driver, and other necessary packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Restore the database:**
    (Only needed for the first time) This command restores the `tatlerDB` database from the backup file.
    ```bash
    mongorestore --gzip --archive=./database/backup/tatlerDB.gz
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    This command starts the API server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart on file changes.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Self-Review Documentation
As this is a solo project, a documented self-review was conducted to detect potential issues.

* **Date:** 08 de Octubre, 2025
* **Reviewer:** Self-review (Luis David)
* **Code Reviewed:** `app.js`, `db.js`

**Checklist & Findings:**
> - **Connection Logic:** The `db.js` module correctly handles the connection and provides a `getDb` function. **Status: OK.**
> - **Server Initialization:** The server in `app.js` correctly waits for a successful database connection before starting to listen for requests. **Status: OK.**
> - **Endpoint Functionality:** Both `GET` and `POST` endpoints for reviews are working as expected. ID validation using `ObjectId.isValid()` was included as a good practice. **Status: OK.**
> - **Error Handling:** Endpoints have `.catch()` blocks to handle potential database errors and return a `500` status. **Status: OK.**
> - **Code Comments & Organization:** The code is commented and organized into logical blocks. **Status: OK.**

**Potential Improvement for Future Sprints:**
> The API currently does not validate the *content* of the request body (e.g., is the `rating` actually a number between 1 and 5?). This could be implemented in a future sprint using a validation library like `Joi` or `express-validator` for more robustness.
